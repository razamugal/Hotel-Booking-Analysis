# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis – Potential 20% Cancellation Reduction  
📊 End-to-End Analytics Project (SQL, Python, Power BI)

## 📁 Project Overview

This is a complete end-to-end data analytics project aimed at understanding and addressing high cancellation rates in hotel bookings. The dataset, containing over 100,000 records, was analyzed to uncover key drivers behind cancellations and to recommend data-backed strategies that could reduce cancellation rates by up to 20%.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Hotels face significant revenue loss and planning inefficiencies due to a high booking cancellation rate (~37%).  
This project aims to:

- Analyze cancellation patterns
- Identify factors influencing cancellations (e.g., pricing, lead time, booking channels)
- Recommend actions to reduce cancellations and optimize room utilization
